# Intro
Hello world my name is Adrian and I am learning how to use GitHub to further my career in IT!
# Hello-World
First Repository
.md stands for mark down - an easy way to view these types of text files
Commit is the same as SAVE
Each commit will have a unique identifier
## Subheader
I can edit files within a code editor as well!
git status - command that shows files that were updated, created, deleted
use git add - command to save/track a file from a codeeditor
git commit - command to commit files onto github, use -m modifier to include a message, it is necessary to -m in order to create a new commit
first -m is the header, second -m is for the description box
